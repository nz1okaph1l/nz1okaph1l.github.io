> This is an Easy machine in hackthebox testing on some simple web app where with some little enumeration we can have access to another user scans in a pcap image. we then use it to get ftp user creds which happen to have been reused in ssh. Then we abuse capabilities set to a python binary to gain root access.
{: .prompt-tip }

# Let's get started
## Scanning and enumeration

We first start with a simple nmap scan to identify the open ports on the target machine given using the command `nmap -A -T5 10.10.10.245 -vv`. We find that we have ports `21`, `22` and `80`.

```shell

21/tcp open  ftp     syn-ack ttl 63 vsftpd 3.0.3
22/tcp open  ssh     syn-ack ttl 63 OpenSSH 8.2p1 Ubuntu 4ubuntu0.2 (Ubuntu Linux; protocol 2.0)

```

We can quickly proceed to check what is on the website at port `80`. We find a security dashboard that show potentially port scans and other scans against the host.

![image](/assets/img/Posts/cap/webpage.png)

Checking around the website we can across the tab `security snapshot(5 second pcap + analysis)` which from the url it is accessed at `/data/[number]`. this became of interest as we can see if we can access other scans by modifying the number on the url.

![image](/assets/img/Posts/cap/data.png)

Brute forcing the number (IDOR) we come across the network capture at id `0`.

![image](/assets/img/Posts/cap/data0.png)

We proceed to download and we open it in wireshark for analysis. we notice that it does contain more `ftp` protocol related traffic. noting that we did find port `21` open, we focus on ftp service related packets to see if we can find any captured credentials.

![image](/assets/img/Posts/cap/ftp.png)

To analyze, right click on one ftp packet, then `follow -> TCP stream` or `Ctrl+Alt+Shift+T` and we do find the user `nathan` tryin to login to the service. And because ftp protocol is an unsecure protocol, we get the creds captured in plaintext.

![image](/assets/img/Posts/cap/ftpass.png)

We then try to login to the servie using the credentials we obtained from the pcap file. And to they do work. not the `user.txt` file is accessible from the ftp.

```shell
‚îå‚îÄ‚îÄ(prorat„âøprosec)-[~/hacks/htb/machines/cap]
‚îî‚îÄ$ ftp 10.10.10.245

```

Lets try the credentials on ssh for potential `password reuse`. And to our luck they do work.

## Initial access

```shell

‚îî‚îÄ$ ssh nathan@10.10.10.245

## Privilege escalation
Who is saying linpeas? Yes linpeas. We run linpeas for faster enumerations and finding ways to escalate our privileges. we have capabilities set to a `python3.8` binary.

![image](/assets/img/Posts/cap/capability.png)

We then check the command we can ran to abuse the permissions given to us in [GTFObins](https://gtfobins.github.io/) and get root's shell.

![image](/assets/img/Posts/cap/capgtf.png)

![image](/assets/img/Posts/cap/capgtf1.png)

Running the command `/usr/bin/python3.8 -c 'import os; os.setuid(0); os.system("/bin/sh")'` gives us a `#` shell.

```shell
nathan@cap:~$ /usr/bin/python3.8 -c 'import os; os.setuid(0); os.system("/bin/sh")'
# whoami
root
# ls /root/    
root.txt  snap
# cat /root/root.txt
<redacted>
# 
```

I hope you enjoyed the write up!!. thank you üòÅ
